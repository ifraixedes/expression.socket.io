# expression.socket.io
This simple and micro node_module was born from my needs to get read/write to the fresh session, used in a express (3.0)/connect node web application, in the socket.io events.

I tested with connect 2.7.3, express 3.1.0 and socket.io 0.9.13, but this it is alpha release becasuse I didn't execute any test framework and in the present time I am using in the development of the first beta of iWaz.at (http://www.iwaz.at) so this module has not been tested by me in any live system.

# Next sections are comming soon !!!

## Installation
